## 1. Why Develop LuaHook

I have been learning AndroLua for a long time. It seems that AndroLua cannot be used to write Xposed modules directly. I found that many projects online also implement using Lua to write scripts for hooking, but some lack good tutorials, do not have non-root solutions, or do not use the simple syntax of Luaj++ for interacting with Java.

## 2. Target Audience

- Security Researchers / Penetration Testing Engineers
- Android Module Developers
- Xposed users who find the learning curve of Frida daunting

## 3. Privacy Policy

This software is only for testing purposes such as CTF. Do not use it to hook official official apps. LuaHook is not responsible for any problems that arise.

## 4. Disclaimer

All development is intended for learning purposes, do not use it for illegal purposes.

If you use this software to hook applications, you are solely responsible for all legal liabilities. This software only provides the function of editing Lua code and hooking. All hook logic behavior is initiated by the user, and we assume no responsibility.
