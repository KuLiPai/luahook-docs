# Q&A

## 😄 **Q: Can I sell LuaHook? I want to get rich!**

**A:** Of course you can sell it! GPL-3.0 doesn't say "don't take money", it just says "don't be a wizard" ——
When you sell the software, **you must also give the "magic spell" of the source code to the buyer**, and allow them to:
1️⃣ Chant the spell for free (Copy)
2️⃣ Modify the spell (Modify)
3️⃣ Open a new magic branch (Redistribute)

👉 **In simple terms:**

>  **"You can sell the cake, but you must include the recipe — and allow the customer to modify the recipe and open a new shop!"**

So feel free to price it! Just don't hoard the source code like a family heirloom. **Selling a combo of software and source code** is completely legal~

---

### ⚠️ **But! Here's the key point (knock on blackboard):**

If a customer buys your LuaHook, **modifies it, and redistributes it**, they **must also open source it**! This is the "contagious nature" of GPL ——
 **"You open source, I open source, the black-hearted boss cries tears"**  😭

---

### 🚫 **Wrong Example**

> Customer: "I bought LuaHook and want to sell a Pro Super Doubled Edition as closed source!"
> You: "Wake up, GPL will come knocking through the internet cable!"

---

### ✅ **Correct Operations**

1️⃣ **Sell binaries + Send source code gift pack** (CD/USB drive/Netdisk link, full of ritual)
2️⃣ **Sell services**! Technical support, custom development, magic crash course —— **GPL doesn't care about selling skills!**
3️⃣ **Post a donation code**: "Donor, you got the source code for free, why not tip a cyber chicken leg?" 🍗

---

### 🤣 **Ultimate Answer:**

>  **"Sell it! Sell it expensive! Just don't lock 'freedom' in a safe — you earn cash, the community earns code, and we all have a bright future ✨"**

(*Legal Disclaimer: Humor aside, for specific operations, it is recommended to consult an open source lawyer. This answer does not cover compensation for mental damages* 😉)

## Q: Can iOS users use it?

**A: Don't mention iOS, iOS/Windows/macOS/HarmonyOS all — cannot use it, currently**

>  **"Currently limited to Android! Unless you:**
>  **• Jailbreak iOS and install 'Android Soul Converter'**
>  **• Make Windows chew on ART Virtual Machine (it has bad teeth)**
>  **• Teach macOS the 'Android Framework Square Dance'**
>  **• Help HarmonyOS open 'Xposed Parallel Universe' ——**
>  **🔨 Hardcore tech? I salute you directly!"**

---

### 🚀 **Q: Can I port it myself?**

**A:**

>  **"The code is all yours! The license allows you to:**
>  **✓ Modify! ✓ Cross-platform! ✓ Redistribute!**
> **Two conditions only:**
> **1. Keep it open source (GPL-3.0 Contagion Warning ⚠️)**
> **2. After successful porting ——**
>  **❗️Be sure to Call me!**
>  **❗️Mention my name in the project!**
>  **（I will: Write you into the README universe / Write a poem for you in binary / Cyber kowtow in thanks）"**
